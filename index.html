                    <section>
                       <p>I am currently a full time student at We Can Code It. I am working on being a full stack developer. I worked in the hospitality industry since I was a teen-ager. That experience led me to become a Sous Chef for a fine dining restaurant. 
                       Years later I made a hobby of mine into a full-time job and opened my own furniture making company. I made furniture for restaurants and hotels. 
                       After many years in the furniture business, I decided to make another interest of mine into a career. I began taking computer science classes which led me to where I am today at We Can Code It.
